Greetings, random visitor!

Now, at this moment, you're observing my profile's README page and my commits activity on this beautiful website, so, go on, I want to introduce myself to you, in my personal format of socializing and presenting.

Lets start from the most important and still easiest, I am computer science student who loves spending time in network, learning something new and playing videogames as everyone else in this surrealistic world.

## Experience in coding

Different programming languages give you different solutions to one problem and thats why I love to, atleast, learn some basics in a big amount of most popular and required preference, but lets start from my main course.

![dotnet]
![javascript] 
![typescript]
![node.js]
![next.js]
![electron.js]
![java]

My prioritised programming language is C# which I love to craziness, its one of my first languages, so, I got the biggest amount experience in it's frameworks and usage:

- Known basics in ASP.NET (including ASP.NET Core);
- Advanced experience in .NET Core and .NET Framework;
- Currently studying Blazor;

As fullstack developer, I of course, studying and work with front-end and computer design in which still haven't got such big experience, but still experiencing something new in every project and task:

- Adept of Javascript with addition of supersets (like TS);
- Advanced experience in Node.js;
- Basic knowledges in NGINX and React.js;
- Currently working with Electron.js and Next.js for my personal and commerical projects;

Inspired by gaming industry, I also learned some technologies because of the games, this list includes some things in which I learnt only basics and how some experience as it:

Greetings, random visitor!

Now, at the moment, you are observing my profile's README and my activity on this beatiful website, so I want to introduce myself to you in my, individual way.

---

So, about me, my name is Miroslaw and I'm student in computer science with big passion about every form about this topic: from front-end to big data either AI.

As any young internet-addict man, I love playing computer games and there are one which gave me first passion to code, so, they are a big part of my life and experience:

- Bugfix in [HOI4][PARADOX] modding, exactly about [R56][ROAD56B].
- Involment in huge amount of modifications for on of the most popular games on our planet - Minecraft.
- ALSO I'm coding some mods myself.

Greetings, random visitor!

Now, at this moment, you're observing my profile's README page and my commits activity on this beautiful website, so, go on, I want to introduce myself to you, in my personal format of socializing and presenting.

Lets start from the most important and still easiest, I am computer science student who loves spending time in network, learning something new and playing videogames as everyone else in this surrealistic world.

## Experience in coding

Different programming languages give you different solutions to one problem and thats why I love to, atleast, learn some basics in a big amount of most popular and required preference, but lets start from my main course.

![javascript] 
![typescript]
![node.js]
![next.js]
![electron.js]
![java]

My prioritised programming language is C# which I love to craziness, its one of my first languages, so, I got the biggest amount experience in it's frameworks and usage:

- Known basics in [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/) (including ASP.NET Core);
- Advanced experience in [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and any knowledge and practice within it;

As fullstack developer, I of course, studying and work with front-end and computer design in which still haven't got such big experience, but still experiencing something new in every project and task:

- Advanced experience in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and classic-clear JS in add-on with supersets;
- Basic knowledges in [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) if case of need;
- At the moment, working with [Electron.js](https://electronjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for my personal and commerical projects;

Inspired by gaming industry, I also learned some technologies because of the games, this list includes some things in which I learnt only basics and how some experience as it:

- Created two UI-based games in Unity 2D: one clicker and other is crafting chemistry game;
- Learned basics of [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [LUA](http://www.lua.org/) for scripting games;

Greetings, random visitor!

Now, at the moment, you are observing my profile's README and my activity on this beatiful website, so I want to introduce myself to you in my, individual way.

So, about me, my name is Miroslaw and I'm student in computer science with big passion about every form about this topic: from front-end to big data either AI.

As any young internet-addict man, I love playing computer games and there are one which gave me first passion to code, so, they are a big part of my life and experience:

- Bugfix in [HOI4][PARADOX] modding, exactly about [R56][ROAD56B].
- Involment in huge amount of modifications for on of the most popular games on our planet - Minecraft.
- ALSO I'm coding some mods myself.

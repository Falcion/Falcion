Greetings, random visitor of my page!

Now, at this moment, you're observing my profile's README page and my commits activity on this beautiful website,
so, go on, I want to introduce myself to you, in my personal format.

As any young internet-addict man, I love to spent my time with computer games and learn something new and this path
is the on which gave me first passion to code, so, this philosophy is a big part of my lifetime experience.

## Experience in code

I have a big passion and goal to be the fullstack data developer, so I have atleast basic experience in a lotta 
things, so lets start from go on.

![DOTNET]

Main programming language in career which from I started my path in coding and so have already gained advanced
experience in working with this beautiful language through three years of coding in it:

- Basic understanding of [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/) and [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor/)
- [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/)
- [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/)
- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/)
- [LINQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/)

![JAVASCRIPT]

Second in my top of most loved programming languages, have worked with vanilla, but prefer frameworks and other
super-sets (alike [TS]()), currently advancing my acknowledgements in it and learning something new about it
everyday:

- Basic experience in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/)

![JAVA]

Language which I learned because of my passion to computer games, obviously, because of the MCP modding and in
addition of my favorite [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp/), so I have only basic experience in it and only used it in modding with [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/).

Lowlighter's metrics are not supported by original developer (at the moment of 22th August, 2025):
so, there is a community fork of this beautiful project - 
https://github.com/gh-metrics/metrics/

There is some history of why fork exists:
https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics/issues/1706

Original project is destabilized into abnormality and isn't supported.
